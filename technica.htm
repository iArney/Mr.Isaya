        As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, 
        the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.
         On the other hand, it is also possible that the displacement of workers by technology will, in aggregate, result in a net 
         increase in safe and rewarding jobs. We cannot foresee at this point which scenario is likely to emerge, and history suggests
          that the outcome is likely to be some combination of the two. <img src="robotic.jpg"> However, I am convinced of one thing—that in the future, talent,
           more than capital, will represent the critical factor of production. This will give rise to a job market increasingly segregated into
            “low-skill/low-pay” and “high-skill/high-pay” segments, which in turn will lead to an increase in social tensions.
             In addition to being a key economic concern, inequality represents the greatest societal concern associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
             The largest beneficiaries of innovation tend to be the providers of intellectual and physical capital—the innovators, shareholders,
              and investors—which explains the rising gap in wealth between those dependent on capital versus labor. Technology is therefore one of the main
               reasons why incomes have stagnated, or even decreased, for a majority of the population in high-income countries: the demand for highly skilled workers has increased while the demand for workers with less education and lower skills has decreased. The result is a job market with a strong demand at the high and low ends, but a hollowing out of the middle. This helps explain why so many workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate. It also helps explain why middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.
         A winner-takes-all economy that offers only limited access to the middle class is a recipe for democratic malaise and dereliction.
